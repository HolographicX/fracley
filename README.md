## Goal
This project aims to build a beginner friendly (yet high performance) visual/astrophotography hybrid telescope at a low budget.


# Features
- Refracting Telescope Design
- 83mm aperture Doublet Lens
- 600mm focal length, f7.2 focal ratio (Customizable! Buy a lower focal length lens and move the lens cell backward.)
- Lightweight and Portable
- 2 inch Focuser
- Built for visual observing and astrophotography. 
- Non-rotating Focuser
- No supports

# Build Guide
> [!CAUTION]
> **This project is currently under development**. Feel free to build a Fracley, however, expect changes to 3D printed parts and the BOM.
> This is a WIP build guide.
- Acquire [BOM](https://github.com/HolographicX/fracley/blob/main/BOM.csv) and [Printed Parts](https://github.com/HolographicX/fracley/tree/main/CAD/STL)
- Insert Heat set inserts in dedicated spots (guide TBD)
- Place the lens elements between Lens Cell Inner and Lens Cell Outer
- Screw the lens cells in with 6 M3 screws. You can use these 6 screws to collimate the telescope later on.
- Attach the front end of the 3 rods to the lens cells, with 3 M3 screws and Inserts around Lens Cell Outer
- Attach Front Cover with 3 M3 screws and inserts right behind the lens cel
- Attach Back Cover around the end with 3 M3 screws and inserts
- Assemble the Focuser according to this [timestamp in the video](https://youtu.be/2xd5qFVNYv8?feature=shared&t=825)
- Attach Focuser Joint to the other end of the rod, with 3 M3 screws and Inserts
- Attach the focuser assembly to Focuser Joint

# Special Thanks
Huge thanks to the community that made this project possible:
- [Hadley](www.printables.com/model/224383-astronomical-telescope-hadley-an-easy-assembly-hig) for the design and Maff for the initial fracley design inspiration 
- [DBS114](https://www.printables.com/model/1179616-dbs-114-astrograph-3d-printable-astrophotography-t) for the Focuser which is based on [ballanux's focuser](https://www.printables.com/model/265768-non-rotating-helical-focuser-with-collet-for-hadle)
