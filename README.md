# Credits
- [Hadley](www.printables.com/model/224383-astronomical-telescope-hadley-an-easy-assembly-hig) for the design and Maff for the initially fracley design inspiration 
- [DBS114](https://www.printables.com/model/1179616-dbs-114-astrograph-3d-printable-astrophotography-t) for the Focuser which is based on [ballanux's focuser](https://www.printables.com/model/265768-non-rotating-helical-focuser-with-collet-for-hadle)
