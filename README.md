# Fracley
A 3D Printable Refractor Telescope based on the [Hadley Telescope](https://www.printables.com/model/224383-astronomical-telescope-hadley-an-easy-assembly-hig).

**This project is currently under development**. Feel free to build a Fracley, however, expect changes to 3D printed parts and the BOM.

# Credits
Huge thanks to the community that made this project possible:
- [Hadley](www.printables.com/model/224383-astronomical-telescope-hadley-an-easy-assembly-hig) for the design and Maff for the initially fracley design inspiration 
- [DBS114](https://www.printables.com/model/1179616-dbs-114-astrograph-3d-printable-astrophotography-t) for the Focuser which is based on [ballanux's focuser](https://www.printables.com/model/265768-non-rotating-helical-focuser-with-collet-for-hadle)
